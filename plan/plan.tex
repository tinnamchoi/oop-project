  \section{Description}
  The game is a text-based, turn-based, player-vs-CPU fighting and adventure game. Initially, the player chooses tocatch 3 Pokemon from a given list of several Pokemon, each with unique details and stats (name, type, level, HP, basicattack, special attack, and defense). It is explained to the player that their objective is to reach a final landmark (the topof Mount Fuji), and that to get there, they will encounter enemies (CPUs), each holding 1 to 3 Pokemon. The player willhave to battle and defeat 10 enemies, each being more difficult than the last. After defeating the 3rd, 6th, and 9thenemy, the player will encounter a new landmark, which will act as a checkpoint. If the playerâ€™s pokemon are alldefeated in a battle, the player will be returned to the most recently passed checkpoint, and if any enemies weredefeated after passing the checkpoint, they will be reset, and the player will have to battle them again. The player winsthe game once they have defeated all 10 enemies, and reached the top of Mount Fuji.
